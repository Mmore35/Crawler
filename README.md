# Really-Unimpressive-Game
The first game I have made. "Game" may be an overstatement. It is an endless, dungeon crawler game. Text based made in Java. Eclipse IDE. May be updated later.
Although this game nothing special, it is completely created by me. All of the ideas for the game where mine and mine alone and was created in my free time as a way to get better at coding. This project taught me so much about programing and is one of the first projects that I can say is totally mine. 

# Gameplay

The gameplay is based on using randomness to make the game replayable and interesting. Almost everything that can be random is including: level of enemies, rarity of gear obtained, distance until the next floor, if the player finds a chest or an enemy, and various other aspects.

# Other

Refer to Versions.txt for update information. Refer to Leaderboards.txt too see if you made the top 5 spots.

Ignore GUI.java for now (GUI.java is a modified version of a graphical user interface I found in a tutorial).

My plans for this project are as follows: Make some sort of working GUI, debug, optimize.
I want to finish this project by having an interface and orginized code I can be proud of.
